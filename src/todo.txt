Terraria mod: List of things to do
-- duplication bug: you can duplicate items that are in your trash slot when you open a chest.
-- bind inventory key to E instead of N
-- finish modifiers for accessories

Future Items + features
Rod of discord: shoots ender pearl that ignores entities.  Pearl shatters into a bunch of sparks after 1 second of not hitting anything (teleports you after it breaks)
Fins: 2x movement speed while in water
Yoyos: controlled with scrollwheel

Hardmode ore generation:
-- Pre-Adamantium stone, Pre-Cobalt stone, etc.
(appears as normal stone blocks, and drops as normal stone)
(when demon altar is broken, these blocks rapidly turn into their respective hardmode ores)
(once the ore is in the world, new chunks will spawn the ore instead of the pre-ore stone)

Hardmode corruption and hallow spread
--Same thing as pre-ore generation, but with pre-corruption and pre-hallowed stone.
